The properties directory is the place to put external configuration for your application.
The .properties files included in this distribution are samples.

The main properties directory is the place for common configuration, which will be used in all environments.
Sub-directories should match the usernames of the user accounts that the application will run in. For example,
you may have different user accounts used for Development, QA, UAT and Production environments. By placing
different versions of your .properties files in these sub-directories, you can apply environment-specific
configuration safely.
