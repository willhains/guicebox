#summary Describes the default logging implementation in GuiceBox.

= Introduction =

ConsoleLogger is the default implementation of `Logger`. It logs everything to `stdout` and `stderr`, so it is useful for getting started quickly without needing to mess around with logging library config files, etc.

= Configuration =

ConsoleLogger is designed to work with zero configuration, and in most cases that's how you will use it. However, a few configuration options are supported. These are described below.

== `@MinLogLevel` ==

If you want to limit the log messages coming out of ConsoleLogger just bind `LogLevel` to a level higher than `DEBUG`, like this:
{{{
binder.bindConstant().annotatedWith(MinLogLevel.class).to(LogLevel.INFO);
}}}
