/**
 * Implements a simple but effective active-passive failover strategy for high availability. There is a maximum of one
 * primary node in the cluster, which advertises its status via UDP heartbeats. The backup node (usually one, but there
 * can be more) waits for a cessation of heartbeats and assumes the role of primary. All nodes continuously ping a
 * well-known address (WKA), ideally a virtual IP that has failover of its own, to ensure that they have network
 * connectivity. This is so a backup node can know whether it has stopped receiving heartbeats because the primary node
 * has died or because it has lost its own connectivity to the network.
 * <p>
 * Each node can be in exactly one of the following {@link NodeState}s:
 * <ol>
 * <li>DISCONNECTED - The node cannot contact the WKA.</li>
 * <li>BACKUP - The node is connected to the network and receiving heartbeats from the primary.</li>
 * <li>VOLUNTEER - The node has volunteered to take over as primary.</li>
 * <li>PRIMARY - The node is currently active and working.</li>
 * </ol>
 * All nodes start up in the DISCONNECTED state, until they have confirmed network connectivity by pinging the WKA. Once
 * a ping response is received, the node transitions to the BACKUP state, and waits for heartbeats from a PRIMARY. If no
 * heartbeat is received within the configured timeout, the node transitions through VOLUNTEER to PRIMARY state and
 * begins sending heartbeats of its own.
 * <p>
 * If two or more nodes simultaneously attempt to become PRIMARY, they will receive each other's heartbeats. A
 * combination of start time and IP address is used to statically determine which node(s) should yield.
 * <p>
 * See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/guicebox/wiki/HotFailover">GuiceBox documentation</a> for details.
